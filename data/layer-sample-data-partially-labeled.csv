Medical Record Number: [Redacted]
Date of Admission: [Redacted]
Date of Discharge: [Redacted]
Length of Stay: [Redacted]

Reason for Admission:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for breast reconstruction due to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the right breast.

Hospital Course:

The patient underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM), sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and breast reconstruction with a de-epithelialized DIEP flap using thoracodorsal vessels as recipient vessels. Postoperative hormone therapy was continued at a nearby medical facility. At an outpatient visit three years and eight months after surgery, a tumor measuring 5mm was detected by palpation at the lower right region of the right breast and a tumor shadow was identified on ultrasound. Further treatment was necessary due to multiple cancer recurrences in the reconstructed breast. Therefore, extensive extirpation of the nipple-areola, breast skin, and initial breast reconstruction with an anatomical tissue expander (TE) were performed at another hospital. Postoperative adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen and leuprorelin was given.

At one year and eight months after insertion of the TE, breast reconstruction with a right S-GAP flap using internal thoracic vessels as anastomotic vessels was performed. The patient did not experience recurrence at two years and five months (four years after the surgery for the recurrence) postoperatively. Areola and nipple reconstruction were performed through transplantation of a part of the contralateral nipple and use of a full-thickness skin graft from the proximal thigh.

Follow-up Care:

The patient has been monitored for four years and currently continues to be seen every three months on an outpatient basis, each time receiving adjuvant therapy with leuprorelin and anastrozole.

Patient: 38-year-old male, with vitiligo and hypothyroidism
Diagnosis: Primary epithelioid angiomyolipoma (EAML) with metastatic disease
Hospital Course:

The patient initially presented in 2011 with gross hematuria, and was diagnosed with a 6-cm renal mass concerning for malignancy. He underwent right radical nephrectomy, and the pathology revealed a primary EAML with limited renal parenchyma involvement. The patient had an uneventful course for 3 years until monitoring identified an asymptomatic 13-cm renal fossa mass in 2014. Repeat surgical resection confirmed recurrent EAML, followed by a third surgical resection with indeterminate margins. In 2014, metastatic EAML was discovered after new retroperitoneal and pelvic implants were detected via surveillance imaging. 

The patient was initiated on everolimus in January 2015 based on a TSC2 deletion revealed during the FoundationOne® targeted next-generation sequencing. A follow-up imaging at 3 months showed a marked reduction in size of the majority of the soft tissue masses. Nonetheless, in September 2015, the patient reported unintended weight loss. Imaging identified slight enlargement of the dominant right renal fossa mass, with progressive anemia indicating disease progression. Everolimus was discontinued and a treatment-directed biopsy was conducted for consideration of a clinical trial.

Paired tumor-germline next-generation sequencing via MSK-IMPACT was performed, but there were no new somatic variants identified to explain the tumors’ acquired resistance. Thus, the patient was offered a clinical trial of off-label nivolumab via the Bristol-Myers Squibb Expanded Access program, and he received two cycles of treatment efficiently. Following nivolumab therapy, imaging after 5 cycles of nivolumab revealed responding disease, and the patient continued the treatment for a total of 2 years. Despite immune-related exacerbation of pre-existing hypothyroidism and cutaneous eruption primarily in areas of pre-existing vitiligo, no dose-limiting toxicities were reported by the patient. 

Nivolumab was discontinued in November 2017 after the patient had already completed 2 years of therapy, as it was deemed that the toxicities would become more severe. The most recent imaging demonstrated continued response and interval calcification of the patient's intra-abdominal tumors. Playback tissue derived from the surgical resection showed high PD-L1 expression and preserved expression of key DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1, confirming MMR proficiency.

Hospital Course:

This is a discharge summary for a 66-year-old female with infiltrating ductal cancer in the lower outer quadrant of her left breast. The patient underwent left partial mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The patient also had bilateral lung masses that were proven to be positron emission tomography (PET) fludeoxyglucose avid. Transthoracic core biopsy of the lung lesions revealed adenocarcinoma acinar type. The case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumour board, and histology suggested three distinct curable primaries: T1N1 breast cancer and bilateral T1N0 lung cancers. The breast cancer was managed with partial mastectomy with sentinel node sampling, adjuvant tangential whole breast irradiation (WBI) with regional nodal irradiation (RNI), and an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole). The bilateral lung primaries were treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). The left and right lung tumors were each treated with 48 Gy in 4 fractions prescribed to the isocenter of each lung lesion, using SABR with volumetric modulated arc therapy technique. The breast and regional nodes (supraclavicular and axilla levels I, II and III) were treated to 50 Gy in 25 fractions using a field-in-field technique in a four-field beam arrangement. All three sites were treated concurrently. The patient completed all her treatments without toxicity.

The patient developed dyspnoea and cough 5 weeks post lung radiotherapy and within 1 week of completing breast radiotherapy. She did not feel her symptoms warranted therapy, and given her diabetic history, steroids were withheld. Her CT scan was consistent with post-radiotherapy changes. Pulmonary function tests showed mild restrictive defect.

The patient was discharged home in a stable condition and without any complications. Follow-up appointments were scheduled as appropriate.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with a longstanding history of pancreatitis in November 2017. She had undergone a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in 1992 after showing symptoms of radiating epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting typically lasting for 1 week and occurring 3-4 times per year. Since that time, she had been periodically followed with pancreatic cancer surveillance. 

In May 2017, the patient started experiencing recurring symptoms of acute pancreatitis, including dull waxing and waning epigastric pain with foods and liquids. The CT scan showed significant calcification in the right-sided pancreatic remnant, and both CA 19-9 and CEA values were elevated. The patient underwent a completion pancreaticoduodenectomy and ethanol nerve block. Intraoperatively, significant adhesions were present, which were lysed. The duodenum was also transected using a gastrointestinal anastomosis stapler. The hepaticojejunostomy was performed using the Roux limb from the prior Puestow procedure, and the duodenojejunostomy was made with the proximal jejunum just distal to the ligament of Trietz. The pathology on the resection specimen demonstrated chronic pancreatitis with parenchymal calcifications and duct ectasia consistent with PRSS1-related HP. No cancer was seen. The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 5.

Patient: [Name], 53-year-old male of Puerto-Rican origin

Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma 

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with persistent hematuria, urinary frequency, weak stream, and nocturia. CT urogram indicated bilateral, irregular, heterogeneous large adrenal masses. Biochemical characterization of masses showed significantly elevated 24-hour urine normetanephrine, leading to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Negative symptoms included flushing, headaches, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, or dizziness, and no history of adrenal tumors, hyperparathyroidism, medullary thyroid cancer, renal cancer, or pituitary tumors. Ultimately, the patient underwent an open bilateral adrenalectomy and paracaval lymph node excision.

Pathology:
Surgical pathology confirmed pheochromocytomas in the bilateral adrenal glands. The paracaval lymph node was described as paraganglioma versus metastatic pheochromocytoma.

Genetic testing:
The patient was offered genetic screening for familial paraganglioma syndromes. With the patient's informed written consent, genomic DNA was isolated from a peripheral blood sample and targeted gene sequencing was performed using PGLNext. The patient was found to have a heterozygous germline mutation, c.524A>G in the VHL gene, corresponding to the Y175C substitution in the protein. This was identified as a likely pathogenic variant and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Treatment:
The patient required vasopressor support and a large amount of crystalloid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to identify one mesenteric lymph node of mildly suspicious appearance which was resected, in addition to a large retroperitoneal paracaval lymph node. The patient was started on life-long glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement.

Outcomes:
The patient's diabetes and hypertension resolved.

Follow-up:
Due to the multifocal nature of the pheochromocytomas and the presence of first-degree relatives likely to be affected, the patient was offered further genetic testing for familial paraganglioma syndromes.

Reason for admission:

The patient, a 78-year-old woman, was admitted to the Department of Neurology after experiencing her third episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures. The patient had previously been diagnosed with a glioma and had received a resection 5 years prior.

Medical History:

The patient had been taking warfarin for 14 years as a secondary prevention measure against embolic events resulting from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Apart from a diagnosis of glioma and warfarin use, the patient’s medical history was unremarkable.

Hospitalization course:

Upon admission, the patient was treated for status epilepticus (SE) with intravenous diazepam to terminate a five-minute episode of GTCS, followed by a loading dose of intravenous valproate sodium (1200 mg) to relieve recurrent GTCS and frequent focal aware seizures. The patient was subsequently prescribed oral levetiracetam (LEV) of 500 mg twice daily once she regained consciousness.

On the second day of admission, routine laboratory studies were conducted, which revealed unremarkable results. The patient’s ECG showed evidence of paroxysmal AF. A carotid Doppler ultrasonography was also conducted, which showed hypoechoic plaques on the anterior wall of the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery.

After 44 hours of admission and a total dosage of approximately 2200 mg of intravenous valproate sodium, the medication was discontinued. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was also conducted, which demonstrated global interictal θ waves (4-7 Hz), but without epileptiform discharges.

On the 3rd hospital day, the patient developed renal dysfunction based on the results of the BUN and serum creatinine levels, which were attributed to insufficient fluid intake. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was found to be elevated, leading to the cessation of oral warfarin medication. A 5mg dose of vitamin K1 was administered intravenously following consultation with a hematologist. The patient remained asymptomatic and was observed without any evidences of bleeding. The repeat brain CT scan also revealed no intracranial hemorrhage. The renal dysfunction was resolved on the 4th day.

Discharge:

The patient was discharged on [Date], with oral warfarin cautiously restarted at a dose of 1.25 mg and titrated back to 1.875 mg while monitoring the INR between 2 and 3.

Follow-up:

The Neurology department recommended a follow-up with the patient in one week to monitor the improvement of her condition. The patient was advised to keep up with the fluid intake and attend regular INR monitoring sessions to check the therapeutic window of warfarin. The patient was also advised to continue taking isosorbide mononitrate and succinate metoprolol for her cardiovascular ailments.

36,"Discharge Summary:

This is a discharge summary for a 53-year-old female who presented with diplopia, nausea, and bony tenderness. Physical exam revealed a right cranial nerve VI palsy and her workup revealed multiple myeloma.

Medical History and Hospital Course:

The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presented with increasing diplopia and nausea for six days. The patient also experienced an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds in the preceding two weeks. Physical exam revealed bony tenderness localized to the ribs as well as a right cranial nerve VI palsy manifesting as impaired right eye abduction. Remainder of the exam was unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest/abdomen revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in the axillary skeleton throughout the thoracolumbar vertebral bodies, and pelvic bones; a healing non-displaced fifth anterior lateral rib fracture was present on the right. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed multiple bone lesions, with a well-defined lesion measuring 12 × 15 mm within the right side of the clivus adjacent to Dorello’s canal.

Hemogram with differential was remarkable for white count of 10,700 k/µL (3.7–10.3 k/µL), with absolute neutrophil count of 7.5 k/µL (1.6–6.1 k/µL). Absolute lymphocyte count was within normal limits (2.42 k/µL (1.6–6.1 k/µL)). Blood chemistry was remarkable for: serum calcium of 15.8 mg/dL (8.9–10.2 mg/dL), ionized calcium of 7.7 mg/dL (4.6–5.1 mg/dL), and glucose of 254 mg/dL (90–120 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone was <10 pg/mL (12–72 pg/mL) and parathyroid hormone related peptide was 1.3 (normal). Urine analysis and urine protein electrophoresis was unremarkable without evidence of Bence-Jones protein. The calculated protein gap between total protein (6.8 g/dL) and serum globulin (2.8 g/dL) was 4.0 g/dL and the albumin/gamma globulin ratio was elevated at 2.4 (0.8–2.0).

Serum protein electrophoresis revealed faint monoclonal immunoglobulin. Serum immune-quantification showed IgG 1150 mg/dL (720–1598 mg/dL), IgA 200 mg/dL (75–400 mg/dL), and IgM 41 (35–225 mg/dL). Kappa light chain was 108.18 mg/L (3.30–19.4 mg/L), lambda light chain 445.32 mg/L (5.71–26.30 mg/L), with a kappa/lambda free light chain ratio of 0.24 (0.26–1.65). Bone marrow biopsy results demonstrated hypercellular bone marrow involved by plasma cell neoplasm (50–60% aberrant lambda restricted plasma cells). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies found evidence of CCND1/IGH gene fusion and gain of chromosome 1q. Flow cytometry of bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a small population of aberrant lambda restricted plasma cells positive for CD38, CD56, moderate CD45 and Lambda, and negative for CD19.

Treatment:

The patient's hypercalcemia was treated with IV normal saline, calcitonin, and pamidronate. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol with oxycodone for breakthrough pain. The patient was evaluated by the hematology-oncology service and received external beam radiation therapy to the clivus, alleviating her cranial nerve VI palsy. Her disease was then managed with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) chemotherapy. With treatment her symptoms resolved.

Follow-up:

Three months into therapy, her repeat laboratory testing demonstrated good response to treatment. The lambda light chain had decreased to 13.1 mg/L (5.71–26.30 mg/L), with a normal kappa/lambda free light chain ratio of 1.0 (0.26–1.65).

Hospital Course:
The patient, an eight-year-old male with giant prolactinoma with extrasellar extension, presented in 2008 with progressive headache and visual disturbances. The patient was treated with high doses of cabergoline, resulting in normalization of prolactin and total tumor shrinkage. In 2013, the patient underwent transcranial excision of the tumor due to its resistance to cabergoline therapy and developed recurrent hypoglycemic episodes during the immediate postoperative period. Biochemical analysis confirmed this to be endogenous insulin dependent hypoglycemia. Imaging located a well-circumscribed lesion in the head of the pancreas, confirmed via histology as an insulinoma with benign characteristics. Six months after the pituitary surgery, the patient received three-field radiotherapy and continued on cabergoline resulting in declining prolactin levels. The patient's baseline echocardiography was normal. The patient is being evaluated for new onset primary hyperparathyroidism due to high calcium levels.

Clinical Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old right-handed man who was admitted to our clinic for radial-side pain associated with the left wrist. He has a history of playing golf and weight training, and the wrist pain had been present for 4 months. The patient received physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid injections twice, but the pain was only temporarily relieved. The patient had no evidence of systemic diseases or trauma history.

Diagnostic Findings:
Upon examination, the patient's wrist showed mild swelling on the radial side, severe tenderness associated with the radial styloid process and moderate tenderness on the mid-dorsal aspect of the radio-carpal joint. He yielded positive results in Finkelstein's test and displayed limited range of motion of the left wrist. The visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain was 10 at rest. The initial plain left-wrist radiograph showed no abnormalities. MRI of the left wrist suggested mild tenosynovitis at the third extensor compartment and intersection syndrome. We clinically diagnosed him with de Quervain's disease and focal synovitis of radio-carpal joint. Upon performing diagnostic wrist arthroscopy and retinacular release of the first extensor compartment for de Quervain's disease, we observed dorsal synovitis, scapho-lunate and lunato-triquetral instability.

Operative Findings:
During the operation, we observed stenosing tenosynovitis at the second extensor compartment with partial tearing. We partially removed the hard bony protrusion. The oblique EPL tendon was found to originate from the ulnar side of the forearm to the radial styloid at the radial and proximal sites of Lister's tubercle. No EPB tendon was found.

Follow-up:
At 12 months follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic at the radial styloid process and able to resume full daily activities.

Impression:
Based on this patient's clinical and operative findings, we can conclude that the patient presented with de Quervain's disease and focal synovitis of radio-carpal joint. The presence of dorsal synovitis, scapho-lunate and lunato-triquetral instability was also observed during operative examination. No evidence of systemic diseases or trauma history was found.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection of T/NK-cell type, systemic form.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted due to a seizure and a history of wasting and worsening health condition for six months. Upon admission, he presented with recurrent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and acute kidney failure. The patient underwent several diagnostic approaches, including CT scan, PET-CT, bone marrow biopsy, and thyroid gland biopsy. These examinations revealed atypical pulmonary infiltrates, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, increased LDH, mild pancytopenia, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Bronchial lavage was positive for Aspergillus antigen, but the patient's symptoms were not fully explained by pulmonary aspergillosis. The high positive proteinase 3 titer (1:135) indicated granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but biopsy of the kidney was not performed due to low platelet counts.

The patient was treated with high-dose steroid burst initially. However, the patient's condition worsened rapidly with further loss of weight and intermittent high fever despite antibiotic and antifungal treatments, and the assumption of granulomatosis with polyangiitis was ruled out. Infectious disease testing, including human immunodeficiency virus, Tuberculosis, Schistosomiasis, Malaria, and Leishmaniosis were negative, except for previous Hepatitis B and EBV infection. EBV DNA in the peripheral blood reached high levels. The clinical criteria for HLH were evaluated, but they were not fulfilled, and no typical findings of HLH were seen in the bone marrow biopsy. 

Treatment:
Based on the data by Sawada et al., the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide as a cooling down step to reduce the high viral load. The patient developed an epileptic seizure and clinical symptoms of meningitis, and a lumbar puncture was performed. Cranial MRI showed typical radiological signs for viral meningitis. The patient was initiated chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) due to the clinical progression. Despite its limited activity for EBV-infection, treatment with foscavir was started. Upon two cycles of CHOP, the EBV load decreased remarkably from 2.8 × 106 copies/mL to < 200 copies/mL. An additional cycle of CHOP was administered and the patient remained in complete remission so far.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with their physician regularly. Further diagnostic imaging, laboratory work, or close clinical follow-up may be required to monitor the patient's condition.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of left thigh and hip pain and swelling. She had a history of chronic left leg sciatic pain and a fall two days prior to the onset of these symptoms. Her past medical history was significant for colon ca requiring a low anterior resection eight years ago. She was noted to be confused and tachycardic, but afebrile with leukocytosis of 14,000. Physical examination revealed significant crepitus to the left thigh and knee, and radiographs confirmed subcutaneous emphysema consistent with necrotizing fasciitis. She received a pelvic CT scan, which further confirmed the necrotizing fasciitis and identified a collection in the presacral space consistent with an AL. 

An exploratory laparotomy with diverting colostomy was done to control the contamination of the leg. The left thigh and hip were incised revealing a significant amount of feculent and purulent drainage, and necrotic, nonviable tissue was debrided. The wound was left open and dressed. The patient remained septic postoperatively and orthopedic and trauma consultants recommended an above the knee amputation with potential hemipelvectomy.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with scalp alopecia and was diagnosed with female pattern alopecia with diffuse and nearly complete hair loss on the central and vertex region with retention of hair on the occipital scalp. She had also experienced hair loss on other areas such as eyebrows, axillae, pubic region, and upper lip. The biopsy from the affected areas of the scalp showed extensive miniaturization of the hair follicles and other changes consistent with alopecia areata.

After reviewing the patient’s history, clinical presentation, and pathologic findings, the diagnosis of antineoplastic (chemotherapy and hormonal) treatment-associated alopecia was established. The patient was started on minoxidil 5% foam to be topically applied to the scalp twice daily.

During the subsequent follow-up visits at four months and six months, the patient showed marked improvement with increased hair regrowth. The central and vertex area of her scalp had thickening of hair, and there was new hair growth on the parietal regions bilaterally. The patient continues to use minoxidil 5% foam once daily.

Admitting Diagnosis: Sjogren's Syndrome

Summary of Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital in February 2013 with complaints of weakness, weight loss, dryness of the eyes, and enlargement of lymph nodes. Her medical history was consistent with a 20-year course of Sjogren's Syndrome. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and reduced levels of C4 complement. The patient's diagnosis of Sjogren's Syndrome was confirmed based on the clinical, serological, and pathological features.

The patient was found to have monoclonal immunoglobulin M kappa with properties of cryoglobulin. Urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays revealed the presence of monoclonal free kappa type light chains. Full staging computerized tomography (CT) scan showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes and mild splenomegaly. Histologic examination of the right axillary lymph node revealed a completely effaced architecture. The patient was diagnosed with concomitant RDD and plasmacytic marginal zone lymphoma.

After undergoing six cycles of MDB, a partial response was achieved, and a follow-up analysis performed did not detect any presence of monoclonal IgM kappa. One month after chemotherapy, a fast-growing firm mass developed in the left mandibular fossa spreading anteriorly to the parotid area. Peripheral paralysis of the facial nerve also occurred. Histological examination of this mass revealed a necrotic tissue interspersed with foci of small lymphoid cells with scarce large tumor cells. Large tumor cells were also present as perivascular and perineural clusters. The resulting condition was considered a transformation of NMZL into an EBV-positive DLBCL, NOS.

R-CHOP immunochemotherapy was prescribed to the patient, but unfortunately, a few days following the completion of the first cycle, the patient suddenly lost consciousness and died. No postmortem study was performed.

Chief Complaint and Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with language articulation disorders, uncoordinated movements, and repeated episodes of seizures that occurred frequently. The patient's stutter had no obvious causes and had existed for one and a half years. The patient had gradually developed unclear enunciation, clumsy speech, and slow responses over time. Within six months prior to admission, he began to have uncoordinated movements, such as ataxia and instable gait. Three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures had occurred in the week just preceding the clinic visit, every episode lasting for about one minute and occurring about once every two days. The patient underwent various tests, including blood tests to check for lactic acid, homocysteine, ammonia, ceruloplasmin, and liver and kidney function, and cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests to analyze autoimmune encephalitis antibodies and genetic metabolic diseases. The tests did not reveal any significant abnormalities, and the EEG showed multiple spikes and slow-wave discharges bilaterally. Brain MRI scans showed high hyperintensities adjacent to the bilateral posterior horns of the lateral ventricles on T2-weighted images and broadened cerebellar fissures. The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy and treated with oral sodium valproate (VPA) at 15 mg/kg per day, which was subsequently increased to approximately 25 mg/kg per day in two weeks. VPA administration was maintained at a varied blood concentration range of 56–78 μg/mL over a period of six months. At the 6-month follow-up, the episodes had decreased from once every two days to about once a month, articulation disorders and uncoordinated movements persisted, and a visual test was performed, which showed no obvious abnormalities.

Medical History and Physical Examination:
The patient was a 5-year-old Chinese male who achieved appropriate developmental milestones before the age of 3.5 years and was born at full-term by vaginal delivery, without any complications. His parents had no known consanguinity, and both they and an older sister were healthy. On physical examination, the length, weight, and head circumference were normal for age, and the patient was conscious and showed normal muscle strength and muscle tone. Patellar reflex and Achilles tendon reflex were normal, and Babinski signs were negative. He was inarticulate and responded to questions slowly. He could not complete the hand-alternating movement test, heel–knee–tibia test, or finger-nose test due to poor cooperation with the instructions. The intelligence quotient value, measured by combined Raven's test, was at a medium level.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy due to the history of seizures and EEG results, as well as LINCL due to the genetic analysis showing a homozygous missense point mutation c.892G > A(p.Glu298Lys) in exon 7 in CLN6. The mutation was not detected in 259 control subjects. PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and MutationTaster analysis suggested that the mutation would negatively affect protein function.

Plan and Recommendations:
The patient was treated with oral sodium valproate (VPA) at a median level to reduce the frequency of seizures, which was considered successful over the course of six months. Articulation disorders and uncoordinated movements persisted, and no significant changes were observed in visual tests. The patient was discharged and recommended to maintain follow-up visits with a neurologist and geneticist to further monitor progression of LINCL.",NO,cancer

Admitting Diagnosis: Abdominal wall tumor
Principal Diagnosis: Foreign-body granuloma
Secondary Diagnosis: Elevated inflammatory markers

Hospital Course:
A 57-year-old Japanese man was admitted to the hospital with increasing right lower abdominal pain. On initial examination, an abdominal wall tumor was detected using transabdominal ultrasound. Laboratory results revealed elevated inflammatory markers. Helical computed tomography (CT) revealed a solid mass and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass that exhibited low intensity. Positron emission tomography–CT revealed fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and a malignant tumor was suspected. Intraoperative findings at laparotomy revealed an elastic, hard, milky-whitish mass with a rough surface and capillary growth in the right lower quadrant. The mass was completely removed, and the surgical margin secured. Pathologic examination revealed that these masses were foreign-body granulomas consisting of string-like crystals and a foreign-body giant cell. Immunohistological staining was positive in cells surrounding phosphoglyceride crystals. The patient underwent regular follow-up abdominal ultrasound examination and CT postoperatively. As of 3 years after the procedure, no signs of recurrence have been detected.

Discussion:
PGDD is a rare disease characterized by deposition of phosphoglyceride crystals. It can sometimes form a large mass and be misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor. Little is known about its etiology and pathogenesis. This deposition disease is apparently triggered by injury and subsequent macrophage aggregation, with a histological picture of deposited crystal radiating from the cell membranes of epithelioid cells. No specific markers exist for PGDD, and differentiating this disease from malignant tumors without pathological examination is difficult.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, a foreign-body granuloma was discovered during the patient's exploratory laparotomy. The mass was completely removed, and the surgical margin secured. Regular follow-up has not revealed any findings suspicious of recurrence.",NO,cancer

The patient, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the psychiatric emergency room with dysmorphic mood. Subsequently, he was referred to medical service to manage hyponatremia. The patient had a past medical history of lumbar spondylosis managed with intermittent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. He occasionally consumed alcohol but denied having any history of diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, binge drinking, abdominal trauma, any offending drugs, and any procedures including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The family history was unremarkable.
During admission, the patient experienced abdominal discomfort that worsened alongside a fever. The patient developed tachycardia and hypotension, and the physical examination was notable for mild tenderness in the epigastrium. Laboratory investigations showed increased levels of hematocrit, leukocytes with neutrophil predominance, platelets, creatinine, C-reactive protein, amylase, and lipase. An alarming laboratory finding was a severe elevation of TGs with mild AP. The diagnosis of HTG-induced AP was established.
The patient received aggressive intravenous rehydration therapy, antiemetics, opioids for pain control, and insulin to decrease TG levels. The patient's condition improved significantly, and apheresis was not performed due to the response to insulin therapy alone. The patient was discharged after his condition had improved, and he began tolerating oral feeds. Fenofibrate was initiated, and empiric antibiotic therapy was stopped due to negative blood cultures.

History of Present Illness:
The patient, a 42-year-old Chinese man, presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of right ear discharge accompanied by discomfort for 3 years. The patient had a history of seawater contact and noticed a small volume of clear drainage from both ears. As the condition progressed, the drainage from the left ear vanished and the drainage from the right ear increased and became a thick, purulent exudate containing debris. The ear canal became obstructed by the thick excretion, which caused the patient to experience mild hearing loss, coupled with intermittent tinnitus, and a sensation of ear fullness. The patient did not use any medications to relieve symptoms, but instead removed debris from the right ear using cotton swabs, which resulted in a return to normal hearing and relief of symptoms. Within a few days, new thick drainage would obstruct the ear canal causing the symptoms to reappear. The patient sought health care twice at local hospitals in Xi’an City from Shaanxi Province; however, the underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve. The discharge from the right ear gradually reduced and turned from brown to white until March 2018, when a low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution was used to rinse the right ear canal at a local hospital.

Past Medical History:
The patient denied any history of infectious diseases, diabetes, or any immunocompromising condition.

Physical Exam:
The patient underwent audiometric and otoscopic examinations as well as radiological examinations using computed tomography imaging to examine the temporal bone. The exudate was collected from his right ear using a sterile swab and was transferred to the clinical microbiology laboratory for examination.

Diagnostic Studies:
The exudate from the right ear was analyzed by the clinical microbiology laboratory. All specimen processing and bacteriological analysis procedures were performed with approval from the ethics committee. The patient provided written informed consent prior to participation in this project.

Assessment and Plan:
The underlying illness causing the right ear discharge and discomfort was not identified, despite seeking health care twice at local hospitals prior to presentation at our clinic. Further testing and evaluation will be needed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Patient: 16-year-old male with history of generalized epilepsy, diabetes, and limb weakness

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with tachypnea, tachycardia, and elevated glucose and lactate levels. Despite treatment for hyperglycemia and fluid resuscitation, the patient's tachypnea and high lactate levels persisted, and he developed limb weakness and external ophthalmoplegia. After several failed attempts to discontinue artificial ventilation, the patient required intubation. Neurological examination revealed external ophthalmoplegia, mild limb weakness, and pyramidal signs. High-density CT signals were observed in the cerebral falx, and T2-weighted MRI revealed areas of high signal intensity in the lateral ventricle, periaqueductal gray matter, and medullary tegmentum. Based on the involvement of multiple systems and the patient's family history, mitochondrial disease was suspected, and muscle biopsy and gene detection studies were performed. The patient was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and immunoglobulin, but symptoms continued to worsen, resulting in myoclonus, ataxia, recurrent pneumonia, and hypotension. Treatment with levetiracetam, L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, nicotinamide, idebenone tablets, and vitamin B was initiated after obtaining the results of the genetic study, resulting in improvement of symptoms.

- Chest pain on exertion
- Stable exertional angina pectoris

Hospital Course:
A 72-year-old man with multiple coronary risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, was admitted to our hospital with chest pain on exertion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular hypertrophy and no segmental wall motion abnormality. Coronary computed tomography angiography revealed significant stenosis in the distal left main trunk (LMT), ostial left anterior descending artery (LAD), and ostial left circumflex artery (LCX). The patient refused a surgical approach and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using a simultaneous jailed balloon and jailed Corsair technique for the left main trifurcation lesion. The post-procedure course was uneventful, and the patient's angina symptoms disappeared. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed two weeks after the procedure, which revealed no signs of restenosis in both the main vessel and side branches.

78,"Hospital Course:
The patient, a 61-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, was admitted to the hospital for recurrent chest pain and fatigue. She was evaluated for worsening anemia, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an RSR pattern in V1 and V2 leads. A stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) was negative for cardiac ischemia. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an atrial mass attached to the anterior wall of the left atrium, and further characterization by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a solid, partly mobile mass attached to the atrial septum and extending to the anterior mitral valve leaflet.

Diagnosis:
The patient underwent a minimal incision valve surgery for resection of the mass, which was presumed to be myxoma based on its location. Intraoperatively, it was noted that the mass originated from the fossa ovalis region of the interatrial septum and infiltrated the atrial wall down onto the entire anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The mass along with a portion of the interatrial septum and the mitral valve was resected. The mitral valve was replaced using a bioprosthetic valve.

Follow-up and Concerns:
Two weeks after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency room with cough, diaphoresis, and palpitations. She was found to be in acute heart failure and was diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation with paravalvular leak. The histopathologic examination of the atrial mass showed a high-grade sarcoma consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Blood cultures were obtained with suspicion of postsurgical infective endocarditis causing valvular dehiscence, but cultures did not grow any bacteria. Due to high suspicion of metastatic disease, MVR and cardiac transplant were not offered until further evaluation for metastasis. Unfortunately, due to rapid clinical decline with a new diagnosis of high-grade cardiac tumor with possible metastases, the patient opted for hospice care.

Summary:
The patient was admitted for chest pain and fatigue, and an atrial mass was discovered and eventually resected during valve surgery. Despite the aftermath of a successful operation, the patient returned to the hospital two weeks later with complications that led to a diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Due to rapid clinical decline and the possibility of metastasis, the patient opted for hospice care.",YES,diabetes

Diagnoses: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with fibrosis, pancreatitis with hyperdense material within the common bile duct

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to her primary care physician for a health maintenance exam and complained of hematuria and pruritus. The CT scan revealed diffuse hepatic steatosis and the follow-up MRI Liver with Gadavist revealed hepatosplenomegaly with hepatic steatosis with no evidence of liver masses. Further serologic testing for elevated alkaline phosphatase levels revealed negative results. The subsequent liver biopsy showed central zone macrovesicular steatosis and a large amount of ballooning hepatocytes with Mallory-Denk bodies, consistent with steatohepatitis with fibrosis. After biopsy, she experienced intermittent bouts of acute chest and epigastric abdominal pain with nausea and increasing stool frequency. Work-ups and imaging modalities showed no defining etiology until the contrasted CT scan finally revealed pancreatitis with hyperdense material within the common bile duct. She underwent EGD that failed to reveal any abnormalities, including any signs of bleeding, but subsequently underwent ERCP with sphincterotomy and 9-12 mm balloon sweep of small blood clot from the left intrahepatic duct. A 10 French by 7 cm stent was placed in the common bile duct and there was adequate bile flow. A follow-up ERCP was performed 8 weeks later and showed no biliary dilation or obstruction.

The patient, a 20-year-old Sri Lankan male, was admitted to our unit with a complaint of weakness in both hands for one month. He had previously been treated for dengue fever at a local hospital and had made a full recovery. However, five days after discharge, he began to experience weakness in his right hand, which subsequently progressed over time. He presented with an inability to write or button his shirt due to the weakness of his hands. The patient also reported mild weakness in both feet that did not significantly interfere with walking. He did not present with any accompanying numbness, parasthesia or pain.

On general examination, the patient had an average build with no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or signs of malnutrition. The patient showcased some small muscle wasting of bilateral hands and feet. The patient had diminished power asymmetrically graded as 3 out of 5 in the right hand and 4 out of 5 in the left hand. Additionally, all fine finger movements were affected along with some degree of weakness in wrist extension. The patient showcased diminished power grade 4 in distal lower limbs (feet). Bilateral foot dorsiflexion was weak, while ankle jerks were elicited with reinforcement. Knee jerks were elicited without reinforcement and there was no objective sensory impairment of touch, pain, temperature, vibration, and joint position sensations in both upper and lower limbs. No cerebellar signs were demonstrated and his gait showed a minimal degree of high-stepping due to weak dorsiflexion.

Clinical Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old right-handed man who was admitted to our clinic for radial-side pain associated with the left wrist. He has a history of playing golf and weight training, and the wrist pain had been present for 4 months. The patient received physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid injections twice, but the pain was only temporarily relieved. The patient had no evidence of systemic diseases or trauma history.

Diagnostic Findings:
Upon examination, the patient's wrist showed mild swelling on the radial side, severe tenderness associated with the radial styloid process and moderate tenderness on the mid-dorsal aspect of the radio-carpal joint. He yielded positive results in Finkelstein's test and displayed limited range of motion of the left wrist. The visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain was 10 at rest. The initial plain left-wrist radiograph showed no abnormalities. MRI of the left wrist suggested mild tenosynovitis at the third extensor compartment and intersection syndrome. We clinically diagnosed him with de Quervain's disease and focal synovitis of radio-carpal joint. Upon performing diagnostic wrist arthroscopy and retinacular release of the first extensor compartment for de Quervain's disease, we observed dorsal synovitis, scapho-lunate and lunato-triquetral instability.

Operative Findings:
During the operation, we observed stenosing tenosynovitis at the second extensor compartment with partial tearing. We partially removed the hard bony protrusion. The oblique EPL tendon was found to originate from the ulnar side of the forearm to the radial styloid at the radial and proximal sites of Lister's tubercle. No EPB tendon was found.

Follow-up:
At 12 months follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic at the radial styloid process and able to resume full daily activities.

Impression:
Based on this patient's clinical and operative findings, we can conclude that the patient presented with de Quervain's disease and focal synovitis of radio-carpal joint. The presence of dorsal synovitis, scapho-lunate and lunato-triquetral instability was also observed during operative examination. No evidence of systemic diseases or trauma history was found. At 12 months follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic at the radial styloid process and able to resume full daily activities.",NO,diabetes

A 77-year-old Caucasian male was admitted with a severe occipital headache associated with nausea and asthenia, spreading to both sides and the front of the head. The patient was a former smoker and had a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obstructive chronic bronchitis. A cranial computed tomographic scan showed an enlarged pituitary gland compatible with macroadenoma, and a subsequent contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a pituitary lesion consistent with pituitary apoplexy. Ultrasound and thyroid scintigraphy suggested immune-related subclinical hyperthyroidism in addition to pituitary apoplexy. During the patient's hospital admission, a hormonal reevaluation revealed secondary hypothyroidism due to pituitary apoplexy. The patient reported being on antihypertensive medications, oral antidiabetics, omeprazole, and prednisone 25 mg daily. The patient was started on levothyroxine substitution (50 μg/d) along with corticosteroid therapy, resulting in gradual recovery from the headache and asthenia. The patient was discharged and advised to continue levothyroxine and corticosteroid tapering for the next few weeks. Follow-up visits were arranged for monitoring. Six months later, the patient remained asymptomatic, with normal thyroid function tests while receiving levothyroxine substitution (50 μg/d), maintained partial response for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma anti-PD1 mAb, and complete resolution of the hemorrhagic areas detected in the initial MRI.",YES,diabetes

Diagnosis: Corneal Ulcer in the Left Eye

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of a corneal ulcer in her left eye. The patient had a history of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for treatment of myelodysplasia syndrome. The patient's corneal ulcer was complicated by severe keratoconjunctivitis sicca and cGVHD affecting the liver, skin, esophagus, mouth, and eyes. The patient's medical status was further complicated by systemic steroid dependence and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus.

Treatment:

The patient was empirically treated with topical 0.5% moxifloxacin (Vigamox, Alcon) that was applied 6 times a day. After 4 days, the treatment failed to improve the condition, and the patient was referred to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Upon presentation, the central cornea was opaque and neovascularized, and there was an epithelial defect with an underlying infiltrate.

Outcome:

Four days after culture and modification of the antibiotic delivery regimen, the corneal ulcer resolved, with re-epithelialization of the cornea surface and resolution of the infiltrate. A strain of E. coli cultured from the lesion was resistant to fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin-sulbactam.

Discharge Plan:

The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with their ophthalmologist and primary care physician. The patient was advised to continue to monitor their symptoms and to follow their treatment plan. They were educated on the importance of maintaining good hygiene practices and avoiding the use of contact lenses until further notice. The patient was advised on the potential side effects of the antibiotics used during treatment and the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics. 

Follow-up:

The patient was referred to infectious disease specialists for further management of antibiotic resistance.

Length of Stay: [REDACTED] days

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the dermatology clinic with severe facial acne, rated grade 4 on the Investigator Global Assessment of Acne scale. The patient had been using topical retinoids for several months with no satisfactory results. The patient was started on 20mg isotretinoin, which was maintained for 6 months. The patient presented with mild chelitis and skin dryness, and complained of mild hair fall. Liver enzymes and lipid profile were within the normal range for both the initial laboratory works and the repeated tests done after one month and four months. The patient experienced total clearance of her acne. However, treatment was interrupted because they could not visit the clinic for several weeks.

Two months after stopping the isotretinoin treatment, the patient developed depigmented lesions reminiscent of acrofacial vitiligo. The pattern of the vitiligo persisted despite topical treatment with Antifungal agents, so the patient was prescribed Tacrolimus 0.1% cream, which led to mild improvement of some of the lesions after eight weeks  before recurrence. The patient, in favor of alternative medicine, opted to cease topical treatment and receive homeopathic treatment instead.

Medical History:
Patient had no history of vitiligo but did have a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus. An auntie had died from renal complications of SLE.

Diagnosis:
Acne, severe facial, clearance achieved with isotretinoin
Acrofacial vitiligo with complaints of depigmented lesions

Treatment:
The patient was treated with 20 mg isotretinoin for six months, which led to complete clearance of her acne. The patient then received Antifungal and Tacrolimus 0.1% topical therapy for her vitiligo with mild improvement after eight weeks, but later stopped it in favor of homeopathic treatment.

99,"Hospital Course:
The patient is a Hispanic male infant born at an outside medical center with uncontrolled gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. He was born large for gestational age (LGA) at 34 weeks with a birth weight of 4.11 kg. His Apgar scores were 2 at 1 min and 6 at 5 min. On day of life (DOL) 2, he was transferred to our hospital for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), supraventricular tachycardia, persistent hypoglycemia, and hypoplastic aortic arch.

Diagnostic Assessment and Treatment:
During the hospital stay, the patient's glucose infusion rate (GIR) was gradually increased to 16 mg/kg/min to maintain plasma glucose close to 70 mg/dL when titrating IV dextrose. Despite consuming 26 cal/oz. of formula, he developed hypoglycemic episodes (BG below 50mg/dL) on DOL 21. A workup for Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) was initiated on DOL 25. The results revealed an elevated insulin level of 16.3 mcIU/mL coincident with a plasma glucose level of 48 mg/dL and beta hydroxybutyrate level of less than 100 mcmol/L. The patient's ammonia, pyruvic acid, cortisol level, serum amino acids, acyl carnitine profile, and urine organic acids were all normal. A DNA sequencing test for CHI revealed a heterozygous maternally-inherited likely pathogenic variant in KCNJ11, c.616C > T (p.Arg206Cys). This variant is rare in population databases (ExAC and gnomAD; 3/242,646 alleles) and damaging according to in silico tools (GERP, SIFT, PolyPhen). Diazoxide was started and plasma glucose levels stabilized above 70 mg/dL at the dose of 15 mg/kg/day by DOL 30.

Hospital Discharge:
The patient was discharged home on DOL 71 with diazoxide at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. His plasma glucose was stable on a similar dose at the time of his last visit, when he was 11 months old. The patient will need close follow-up with a pediatric endocrinologist to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust medication dosages if necessary.

Hospital Course:

The 75-year-old male patient was admitted with elevated serum hepatobiliary enzymes and a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, malignant otitis externa, and an operative history of emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. The results of preoperative laboratory testing showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamic transpeptidase. Imaging tests indicated the presence of a Bismuth type 4, T2N0M0 Stage II hilar cholangiocarcinoma with abrupt narrowing of the common hepatic duct and involvement of the right anterior and posterior bile duct bifurcations. Further investigation confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

Treatment:

The patient underwent left trisectionectomy, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy 51 days after undergoing percutaneous balloon arterioplasty followed by bare-metal stent placement to prevent postoperative biliary complications due to the suspected benign stricture caused by atherosclerosis in the right posterior hepatic artery (RPHA).

Clinical Course:

The patient had bile leakage postoperatively, which was successfully controlled through percutaneous drainage. However, he was re-hospitalized with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses 4 months after hepatectomy that eventually led to liver failure. Despite intensive multimodal treatment for the pyogenic liver abscesses, the patient could not be saved.

Disposition:

The patient was discharged from the hospital 3 months after surgery but was re-hospitalized due to complications related to liver abscesses. Unfortunately, he passed away due to liver failure 14 months after surgery.",YES,diabetes
